# Generative Art with p5.js

Welcome to my p5.js art collection! This repository showcases a series of generative artworks I've created using p5.js, a creative coding library in JavaScript. Each piece is accompanied by its corresponding code, allowing you to explore the creative process behind every visual.

## Gallery

Below are some of the pieces from the collection. You can find both the artwork and the code for each sketch.

## Explore the Code

Each artwork is generated through a p5.js sketch. You can browse the code in the `/sketches` directory.

- [Sketch 1](./sketches/sketch1.js)

- [Sketch 3](./sketches/sketch3.js)

Feel free to experiment with the code to create your own versions of the pieces!
